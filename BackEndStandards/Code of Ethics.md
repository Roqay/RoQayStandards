# RoQay Development Team Code of Ethics


1- Always communicate. <br>
2- Always be online on Teams . <br>
3- Follow the git-flow principles  https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow. <br>
4- Don't hesitate to review other people's work. I always welcome criticism.<br>
5- Always get your PR code reviewed by somebody else. <br>
6- Please do not self-merge unless seriously needed (like a critical bug that needs to be deployed ASAP).<br>
7- Always keep your PR up to date. Rebase frequently.<br>
8- We love screenshots of work, share with us what you are working on. It helps the code reviewer understand your work better.<br>
9- Follow PHP/LARAVEL best practices. <br>
10- Follow PHP style guides https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/ <br>
11- Be consistent with other people's way of doing things but feel free to discuss improvements. <br>
12- Always be testing. We don't require 100% test coverage but we do take testing really seriously.<br> 
13- If you can't immediately write a test for a method, make sure to still write a test case and just put pending 'explain the reason why so you or somebody else can return to it later. <br>
14- We don't need our code to have a lot of comments. Good code is like a good joke, it doesn't need an explanation. Make your code readable instead. <br>
15- We put more weight on code clarity. <br>
16- We love metaprogramming but stop metaprogramming just for the sake of doing it without any added value. Again, code clarity. <br>
17- Make use of special ANNOTATIONS like # TODO:, FIXME:, OPTIMIZE: so rake notes can pick it up. <br>
18- Found a bug? Do not wait. File immediately on GitHub issues! We get notified instantly anyway. <br>
