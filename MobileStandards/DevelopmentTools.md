# Development Tools

Development tools used by `RoQay` mobile team.

## Android Development Tools

For native `Android` projects we are developing them using [`Kotlin`](https://kotlinlang.org) programming language and [`Android Studio`](https://developer.android.com/studio) IDE.

## iOS Development Tools

For native `iOS` projects we are developing them using [`Swift`](https://www.swift.com) programming language and [`Xcode`](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) IDE.

## ReactNative Development Tools

For hybrid `ReactNative` projects we are developing them using [`JavaScript`](https://www.javascript.com) programming language but it is prefered to use [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to provide you with syntax for types.

For hybrid `ReactNative` projects code editing we are using [`Visual Studio Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com).

### Recommended JavaScript Tools

If you are developing hybrid `ReactNative` project using `JavaScript` it is prefered to use [`Flow`](https://flow.org) to provide you with static type checking for `JavaScript`. But it is recommended to use `TypeScript` instead of `JavaScript` as it contains types internaly.
